# Busta Games Unity Utilities

Code I use for my games and game jams.
I decided to open it since I already make my game jam games source code available. 

Hope someone else can find my utilities code useful for their own game jam projects, or even more.

Also, feel free to fix bugs or submit improvements. 

# Configuring

Some options might work:
- Checkout the code directly into your project folders.
- Use package manager manifest to get from github or directly from your computer.
  - Add one of the following entries 
  - ``` "games.busta.utilities":"file:../../BustaGames.Utilities",```
  - ``` "games.busta.utilities":"https://github.com/ricardobusta/unity-utils",```
- Add a symlink inside the Package folder to your project. 
  - On windows, run admin cmd and use `mklink /D <PATH_INSIDE_PROJECT_PACKAGES> <PATH_TO_REPOSITORY_FILES>`
  - On Mac or Linux, run `ln -s <PATH_TO_REPOSITORY_FILES> <PATH_INSIDE_PROJECT_PACKAGES>`
- Soon: Maybe OpenUPM? ðŸ¤·
